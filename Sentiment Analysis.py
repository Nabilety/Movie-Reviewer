# ## Transforming documents into feature vectors

# By calling the fit_transform method on CountVectorizer, we just constructed the vocabulary of the bag-of-words model
# and transformed the following three sentences into sparse feature vectors:
# 1. The sun is shining
# 2. The weather is sweet
# 3. The sun is shining, the weather is sweet, and one and one is two
# Transforming words into feature vectors

                 'The sun is shining, the weather is sweet, and one and one is two'
                 ])
bag = count.fit_transform(docs)

# Now let us print the contents of the vocabulary
# to get a better understanding of the underlying concepts:
print(count.vocabulary_)

# As we can see from executing the preceding command, the vocabulary is stored in a Python dictionary,
# which maps the unique words that are mapped to integer indices. Next let us print the feature vectors that we just created:
print(count.get_feature_names_out()) # the column indices in this will represent the column features in the matrix below
print(bag.toarray()) # each row represents the sentences we constructed in docs

# Each index position in the feature vectors shown here corresponds
# to the integer values that are stored as dictionary items in the CountVectorizer vocabulary.
# For example, the  rst feature at index position 0 resembles the count of the word and,
# which only occurs in the last document, and the word is at
# index position 1 (the 2nd feature in the document vectors) occurs in all three sentences.
# Those values in the feature vectors are also called the raw term frequencies:
# *tf (t,d)*â€”the number of times a term t occurs in a document *d*.
